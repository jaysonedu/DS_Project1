    "## SECTION 3: Data Overview Findings \n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "## Initial Data Exploration Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Housing Data Characteristics\n",
    "Our analysis focuses on NYC properties (State = \"NY\"), yielding comprehensive coverage of the metropolitan area. The dataset contains 321 columns representing geographic identifiers and monthly home values from January 2000 through December 2025. This longitudinal structure allows us to track price trends over more than two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crime Data Characteristics\n",
    "The crime dataset contains 577,674 complaint records with 36 variables describing each incident. Key fields include offense descriptions, borough locations, law categories (felony, misdemeanor, violation), and temporal information. This substantial sample size provides robust insights into crime patterns across NYC neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demographics Data Characteristics\n",
    "The demographics dataset covers 33,772 geographic areas with 12 socioeconomic variables including population size, median household income, median age, educational attainment (bachelor's degrees), and employment statistics. This granular data enables neighborhood-level analysis of demographic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Data Characteristics\n",
    "The economic indicators dataset tracks two critical metrics over time: the 30-year fixed mortgage rate (MORTGAGE30US) and the Federal Funds rate (FEDFUNDS). These indicators reflect broader economic conditions affecting housing affordability and demand.\n",

    "## SECTION 4: Visualization Interpretations \n",
    "\n",
    "### Chart 1: Housing Price Trends\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Analysis: Housing Price Trends Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization displays housing value trajectories for five sample NYC ZIP codes over approximately 300 months (2000-2025). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- **Strong upward trend**: All ZIP codes show substantial price appreciation from 2000 to 2025\n",
    "- **2008 Financial Crisis impact**: A notable dip is visible around the 100-month mark (2008-2009), reflecting the housing market crash\n",
    "- **Recovery period**: Prices recovered and exceeded pre-crisis levels by approximately month 150 (2012-2013)\n",
    "- **Price variation**: ZIP codes show different price levels, with the orange line (ZIP 11385) consistently commanding the highest values (reaching ~$850,000)\n",
    "- **Recent acceleration**: The steepest growth appears in the most recent period (months 250-300), corresponding to 2020-2025\n",
    "\n",
    "The diverse price trajectories suggest that location within NYC significantly affects both absolute home values and appreciation rates.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chart 2: Price Distribution\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Analysis: Current Home Value Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This histogram reveals the distribution of current NYC home values with key statistical insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- **Right-skewed distribution**: The majority of homes cluster in the lower price ranges, with a long tail of high-value properties\n",
    "- **Median value**: $306,920 (shown by red dashed line) represents the typical NYC home value\n",
    "- **Concentration**: Most properties (>500) fall in the $200,000-$400,000 range\n",
    "- **Outliers**: A small number of properties exceed $1 million, with some reaching $6 million\n",
    "- **Affordability gap**: The median is substantially lower than the mean ($458,458), indicating high-value outliers pull the average upward\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution pattern is typical of urban housing markets where a subset of premium neighborhoods command significantly higher prices.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chart 3: Crime Types\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Analysis: Most Common Crime Types\n",
    "\n",
    "This horizontal bar chart ranks the 15 most frequent crime categories in NYC:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- **Petit Larceny dominates**: With over 110,000 incidents, petit larceny (theft of property valued under $1,000) is by far the most common crime\n",
    "- **Harassment ranks second**: Approximately 95,000 harassment incidents were reported\n",
    "- **Property crimes prevail**: The top crimes are predominantly property-related (larceny, burglary, theft-fraud, motor vehicle theft)\n",
    "- **Violent crimes present**: Assault and felony assault appear in the top 15, though at lower frequencies than property crimes\n",
    "- **Quality of life offenses**: Categories like \"offenses against public administration\" and \"vehicle and traffic laws\" indicate substantial enforcement of quality-of-life violations\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these crime patterns is important for neighborhood safety perceptions, which can influence housing demand and prices.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chart 4: Crime by Borough\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Analysis: Crime Distribution Across NYC Boroughs\n",
    "\n",
    "This bar chart compares total crime incidents across NYC's five boroughs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- **Brooklyn leads**: Approximately 162,000 incidents, making it the borough with the highest crime volume\n",
    "- **Similar levels in major boroughs**: Manhattan (~136,000), Bronx (~130,000), and Queens (~124,000) show relatively comparable crime totals\n",
    "- **Staten Island significantly lower**: Only ~24,000 incidents, roughly one-sixth of Brooklyn's total\n",
    "- **Null values minimal**: A small category labeled \"(null)\" suggests high data quality with few missing borough identifications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Context**: These raw counts don't account for population differences. Brooklyn and Queens have larger populations than Manhattan, so per-capita crime rates may tell a different story. Staten Island's low count aligns with its smaller, more suburban character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The borough-level variation suggests that location choice significantly impacts neighborhood safety characteristics.\n",

    "### Chart 5: Economic Trends\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Analysis: Economic Indicators Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual-line chart tracks two critical economic metrics from 2023 to 2026:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mortgage Rates (Orange line - MORTGAGE30US):**\n",
    "- **Peak period**: Rates peaked around 7.5% in mid-2023\n",
    "- **Declining trend**: Gradual decrease to approximately 6.0-6.2% by early 2026\n",
    "- **Volatility**: Notable fluctuations throughout the period, reflecting Federal Reserve policy changes\n",
    "- **Affordability impact**: The decline from 7.5% to 6% represents significant improvement in monthly payment affordability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Federal Funds Rate (Blue dots - FEDFUNDS):**\n",
    "- **Peak around 5.3%**: Reached highest point in mid-2023\n",
    "- **Recent decline**: Decreased to approximately 3.5-3.8% by 2026\n",
    "- **Policy shift**: The downward trend suggests a transition from aggressive interest rate hikes to a more accommodative monetary policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Housing Market Implications:**\n",
    "- Lower mortgage rates in 2025-2026 likely contributed to the housing price acceleration observed in Chart 1\n",
    "- The spread between Fed Funds and mortgage rates narrowed, reflecting improved market conditions\n",
    "- These favorable financing conditions may have supported continued demand despite high absolute price levels\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Chart 6: Box Plot\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Analysis: Home Value Distribution Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This box plot provides a statistical summary of NYC home value distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- **Median (orange line)**: Approximately $300,000, confirming our earlier histogram analysis\n",
    "- **Interquartile range (box)**: Most homes (50%) fall between roughly $200,000 and $500,000\n",
    "- **Outliers (circles above)**: Numerous high-value properties extend well beyond the typical range\n",
    "- **Extreme outliers**: Several properties valued at $3-6 million represent ultra-premium real estate\n",
    "- **Compact lower range**: The lower whisker is relatively short, indicating few properties below $100,000\n",
    "- **Long upper tail**: The extensive outlier distribution confirms significant price stratification\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization reinforces that while most NYC homes cluster in a moderate price range, a substantial luxury market segment exists, driving up average values and creating affordability challenges.\n",
